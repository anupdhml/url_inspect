option to pick the next-best url list
cleanup domain tables
sorted json
find a better way to score urllists (length, score...)..this should also block overly long urlsets
update table with what user finds
maintain a log file

future:
    url-list extraction based on depth
    after this:
        remove duplicate sets from the collection of link sets.
        duplicates occur because we are searching for both 'ul' and nav-id.
        duplicates kept for now as it actually gives priority to the
        keywords occuring in nav bars...
